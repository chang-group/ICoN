## Internal Coordinate Net (ICoN) for Sampling Conformational Ensembles of Highly Dynamic Proteins via Generative Deep Learning

1. ICoN is trained on ~10000 of fully atomistic and highly flexible conformations

2. It uses vector internal coordinate representation as input features- vBAT

3. It can train ~10K conformations in a few mins, and generate ~100K conformations in less than a min.



## Dependancies
- `python` 3.8 >
  - pytorch - for Deep Learning
  - `MDAnalysis` - for trajectory I/O
  - `pytraj` - for analysis

## Installation

- Clone the repository:
  *git clone https://github.com/chang-group/ICoN.git*
- Navigate to corresponding folder for further instruction
